# Project 2: Development of Convolutional Neural Network Model for Identification of Alzheimerâ€™s Progression from MRI - Team LAN 

## Repository Contents 

## SRC
### Installing/Building the Code
Our approach will be a Convolutional neural network algorithm (CNN). To build the code, we're primarily utilizing the Keras API running on TensorFlow. 

The following packages will need to be installed in order to build the code: keras, tensorflow, plotly, htmltools, caret, NbClust, and dplyr.

### Code Usage
Using the code above, found in SRC/Proj 1, run the file SRC/MI3 after downloading the following additional packages: cluster, facetoextra, caret, devtools, ggplot, and gridExtra. MI3 will use the final airbnb dataframe created in Proj 1 to conduct kmeans clustering with three clusters for each of the six neighborhoods in D.C. with the highest quantity of airbnb reviews.
